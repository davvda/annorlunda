## An Ecophilosopoetic Attempt at Sense-Making
---
**Predicaments**
Problems require solutions, predicaments require management. Predicaments in the landscape are categories of a unfortunate or trying conditions. The landscape further includes the main predicament of modern day humanity, namely the complex and extensive network of connections between the predicaments. These connections are the reason why we seem unable to untangle ourselves from what appears to be solvable, if not already solved, problems. If we do not manage the predicaments of the landscape wisely we will lose everything. This is the challenge of our time and we must attempt to make sense of it to the best of our ability. This landscape attempts to do that. By mapping the landscape and its features, describing what they are and how they're connected, my belief is that we might be able to go from an oversimplified narrative to a slightly more complex and interconnected understanding of our predicament.

**Ecology, Philosophy, and Poetry**
No single branch of science or the arts is enough to make sense of the complexity of our predicament. Instead, this project will move in-between and on the edges of whatever disciplines are necessary. There are however three that stick out, namely: ecology, philosophy, and poetry. Ecology is the study of our dwelling place. Philosophy is a love of wisdom as well as a comprehensive system of belief and principles. Poetry is... a difficult one to define. Which is its strength. Poetry is the process of emergence of something that did not previously exist. Poetry is making. Poetry tries to capture the unspeakable in words. Putting all of these together as ecophilosopoetic:

*A philosophy for the making of our dwelling place*

**The future**
Discovering this landscape might lead to a sense of impending doom, hopelessness, and despair. Maybe rightly so. William Gibson said "the future has arrived, it's just not evenly distributed". There are ways of managing these predicaments and their connections and many are already being employed. I therefore finish off every description of a predicament and its connections with a more speculative discussion of existing or potential management methods. The positive thing with complexity in this case is that just as we can't know what creates negative cascade effects we also can't be sure what creates positive ones. Complexity allows for emergence and unexpected behaviour. In other words, if there is room for complete despair there is also room for hope. My intention is two-fold. First, it is vital to recognise just how difficult of a situation we are in and, second, it is crucial to recognise that there are things we can and must do to manage the situation. What area of the landscape do you have an interest in? What predicament could you help manage? Which predicaments are related to what you're working to change? How might changing those predicaments affect the management of the predicament you're focused on? Are there people prioritising predicaments you don't care about? Why do you think they prioritise in that way and what might be the reason for your indifference? 

A problem well-stated is half-solved. This landscape does not give solutions nor answers. My hope is that it leads those exploring it to find agency in discovering the right questions.

*David Janzi, 2024*

**Note: In Progress**
As you can probably see, much of the landscape is undiscovered. I have chosen to work publicly on this project and new predicaments will be revealed on a weekly basis until the entire landscape has been mapped.

**Note: Disagreement**
Do you disagree with something? Do you think something is blatantly wrong or deluded? Do you think something here might create more problems? Do you have something you think should be added? Don't hesitate to write me an email. I'm grateful for any feedback or input that you might have. I'm not an expert, I'm just an innocent explorer trying to slowly wander upon truths.

I put several hours into this each day and this wouldn't be possible without me quitting my previous job. If you have found value in this project and you have a steady income I would be grateful for any donations you could give. If you need further incentive most of the donations will go to feeding my dog Hilma.

# The Predicaments
## Soil erosion
**Soil erosion is the wearing away of the upper layer of soil**. This thin layer of dust on the crusty surface of a billiard ball is what supports all life. Without it nothing can grow or live.

We are [gnawing away](https://www.etymonline.com/word/erosion) at the topsoil of the Earth with increasing speed and ferocity, consuming what isn't ours.

> It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.
> 
> - Gandalf (J.R.R. Tolkien), Lord of the Rings

Soil erosion has several causes, some (or presently most) which are affected or generated by human activities. These include agricultural practices such as tillage, monocropping, pesticide use, and chemical fertilizers; deforestation, roads and cities, as well as climate change more generally.

> For many years, my walks have taken me down an old fencerow in a wooded hollow on what was once my grandfather’s farm. A battered galvanized bucket is hanging on a fence post near the head of the hollow, and I never go by it without stopping to look inside. For what is going on in that bucket is the most momentous thing I know, the greatest miracle that I have ever heard of: it is making earth.
> 
> The old bucket has hung there through many autumns, and leaves have fallen around it and some have fallen into it. Rain and snow have fallen into it, and the fallen leaves have held the moisture and so have rotted. Nuts have fallen into it, or been carried into it by squirrels; mice and squirrels have eaten the meat of the nuts and left the shells; they and other animals have left their droppings; insects have flown into the bucket and died and decayed; birds have scratched in it and left their droppings and perhaps a feather or two. This slow work of growth and death, gravity and decay, which is the chief work of the world, has by now produced in the bottom of the bucket several inches of black soil…The old bucket started out a far better one than you can buy now. I think it has been hanging on that post for something like fifty years.
> 
> However small a landmark the old bucket is, it is not trivial. It is one of the signs by which I know my country and myself. And to me it is irresistibly suggestive in the way it collects leaves and other woodland sheddings as they fall through time. It collects stories, too, as they fall through time. It is irresistibly metaphorical. It is doing in a passive way what a human community must do actively and thoughtfully. A human community, too, must collect leaves and stories, and turn them to account. It must build soil, and build that memory of itself- in lore and story and song- that will be its culture. These two kinds of accumulation, of local soil and local culture, are intimately related.
> 
> In the woods, the bucket is no metaphor; it simply reveals what is always happening in the woods, if the woods is left alone. Of course, in most places in my part of the country, the human community did not leave the woods alone. It felled the trees and replaced them with pastures and crops. But this did not revoke the law of the woods, which is that the ground must be protected by a cover of vegetation and that the growth of the years must return- or be returned- to the ground to rot and build soil. A good local culture, in one of its most important functions, is a collection of the memories, ways, and skills necessary for the observance…of this natural law.
> 
> If the local culture cannot preserve and improve the local soil, then, as both reason and history inform us, the local community will decay and perish, and the work of soil building will be resumed by nature. A human community, then, if it is to last long, must exert a sort of centripetal force, holding local soil and local memory in place. Practically speaking, human society has no work more important than this.

## Pollution
**Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change**. It comes not only in the form of chemicals but rather it can be almost anything. Air pollution, electromagnetic, light, litter, noise, chemical, radioactive, visual, thermal, medial, water, material, mental, physical, etc. We live in an increasingly polluted world where [no place is left clean](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02592).

Pollution is [defilement and desacration](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pollution).

## Tipping points
Many complex systems have the characteristic that **after a certain amount of gradual change a tipping point is reached where the entire system changes drastically** or even completely collapses. The possibility of unknown tipping points makes any attempt at delaying the management of current predicaments potentially catastrophic. An important addition, however, is that tipping points can be both negative and positive, meaning that identifying and working towards positive tipping points should be of high priority. One example of such a tipping point might be that if a certain number of people begin changing how we do things it might create a discrete phase shift that rapidly includes everyone in the change process.

## Ecological crisis
Ecology is the [study of our dwelling place](https://www.etymonline.com/word/ecology), more specifically a field of science studying the interconnected systems of Earth. 

**The ecological crisis is a destabilisation or breakdown of these systems large enough to threaten humanity's continued survival**. It is, however, important to include other organisms in this since the ongoing man-made ecological crises are causing the extinction of multiple species every day. From a systems-thinking perspective every species going extinct reduces an ecosystem's options to restabilise after a destabilising event. It is therefore not unlikely that we end up snowballing the effects of climate change by reducing the resilience and complexity of ecosystems past the point where a recovery is possible.

## Extreme weather
**Extreme weather is any weather condition at the extremes of whatever has been observed and recorded in the past** and includes heat waves, cold waves, storms, etc.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as "an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations."

Human activites is most likely the main driver of the increased frequency of extreme weather events. 

Extreme weather can also act as warnings and omens. Will we listen?

## Biodiversity loss
Biodiversity is often defined as "the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region". Another definition might be *variety of life*. Biodiversity loss could therefore be seen as a **reduction in the variety of life**.

Biodiversity loss can include the decrease, disappearance, or extinction of a species in a specific area or globally. The current primary driver of biodiversity loss appears to be habitat destruction (mainly for agriculture), which includes deforestation, as well as climate change more generally. [The current rate of global biodiversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 higher than the naturally occurring rate which is faster than at any other time in human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss).

The ongoing biodiversity loss is sometimes called the holocene extinction.

## Desertification
[Desertification is a type of land degradation whereby fertile areas become arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification). This typically results from deforestation, drought, or inappropriate agricultural practices. 

Comparing a [map of global desertification vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification#/media/File:Desertification_map.png) with a [map of armed conflicts](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/countries-in-conflict-data?facet=none&Measure=Conflict+deaths&Conflict+type=All+armed+conflicts&Conflict+sub-type=Across+all+sub-types&country=AFG~ETH~SYR~UKR) hints at something.

## Deforestation
**Deforestation is the removal and destruction of forests**. [The UN FAO estimate that 10 million hectares of forest are cut down each year.](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation) Two points of importance: one is that there is a difference between deforestation and net forest loss since forests are also regrowing and being replanted, second is that deforestation peaked in the 1980s. It is, however, also important to note that not all forests are equal and here we run into the potential issue with relying too heavily on quantification. We could most likely make most of the planet net positive in forest growth quite quickly by planting trees faster than we're removing them. The question is if we have a reason to trust our claimed understanding of the differences between artificially planted forests and naturally growing ones. Maybe we do? Do we truly understand what a forest is or are we missing it for all the trees?

## Climate change
**Global changes in average temperature**, [from equator to poles](https://www.etymonline.com/word/climate), means a change in the Earth's climate. The climate is never static but what makes climate change a predicament is the speed at which it is currently happening, threatening the stability of the Earth's climate system and thereby our survival. Put simply, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial practices add greenhouse gases which trap heat in the lower atmosphere. This leads to global warming and rapid climate change. The global nature of climate change means it contributes to and potentially creates several related predicaments. This is the main reason why climate change specifically is a main focus in the discussion of our continued survival. It is, however, not certain that lowering the global temperature by any means necessary will lead to the desired effects. 

In some ways the predicament of climate change has been defined too narrowly, potentially leading to an illusion of understanding its complexity and thereby trusting that a solution is within our grasp as soon as we choose to grab it. This is one reason for why such a "simple" problem hasn't been prioritised at the cost of growth. Every predicament is interrelated but the increase in trapped energy on Earth might end up affecting all of them.

## Microplastics
**Microplastics are small fragments of any type of plastic** (<5 mm). Unless they are designed to be biodegradable they tend to accumulate in the environment, particularly in water but also the air and soil. They are mobile, persistent, and difficult to remove from nature. [Over 80% of the microplastic in the environment comes from textiles, tires, and city dust](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/microplastics-from-textiles-towards-a). The environmental and health impacts of microplastics are uncertain but it isn't unreasonable to think that an accumulation of synthetic non-degradable material in all living organisms could end up being catastrophic. 

> Although man’s record as a steward of the natural resources of the earth has been a discouraging one, there has long been a certain comfort in the belief that the sea, at least, was inviolate, beyond man’s ability to change and to despoil. But this belief, unfortunately, has proved to be naïve.

## Ocean acidification
**Ocean acidification means an increased concentration of hydrogen ions in seawater**, meaning more acidic water. [The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html) and a series of chemical reactions means this absorption of carbon dioxide leads to an increase in hydrogen ions. The ocean turns sour. As we continue to annoy the ocean and destabilise it we are risking disrupting all life it contains and supports. To be blunt, this includes us and everything else. Don't piss off the ocean.

> It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.

## Planetary boundaries
**[The planetary boundaries concept presents a set of nine planetary boundaries within which humanity can continue to develop** and thrive for generations to come](https://www.stockholmresilience.org/research/planetary-boundaries.html). These nine boundaries are: novel entities, stratospheric ozone depletion, atmospheric aerosol loading, ocean acidification, biogeochemical flows, freshwater change, land-system change, biosphere integrity, and climate change. 

![[planetary_boundaries.png]]
As can be seen in the figure we are currently [beyond six of the nine planetary boundaries](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.adh2458). Important to note is that the notion of planetary boundaries can include other models than the nine boundaries above.

## Loss of insect biomass
Insects make up 90% of all animal species on Earth and are crucial parts of all ecosystems with pollinators being particularly important for the food supply for other animals and humans. Insect decline is a complex area to study and estimates on the rate of decline vary in different localities. A 2020 meta-analysis estimated a decline rate of 9% per decade for terrestrial insects but, notably, an increase in freshwater insects of 11% per decade. Most research, however, show declines in insects globally.

> A March 2019 statement by the [Entomological Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America "Entomological Society of America") said there was not yet sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects and that some of the extrapolated predictions might "have been extended well past the limits of the data or have been otherwise over-hyped"

I wonder what to make of the quote above. Data can always be misleading but if we are actually risking a mass extinction of insects I don't see how taking that seriously is over-hyping. If what we need to change current trends is to wait for "sufficient data" to be collected then we really are fucked.

> We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts.

## Waste
**[Waste is anything discarded as worthless or of no use](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waste)**. To waste is to use something carelessly. The [majority of material waste comes from mining](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-waste-generation) and quarrying which, in 2019, was at around 450 million tonnes compared with household material waste at around 2 million that same year. There's nothing wrong with doing your recycling to play your part but just keep that disparity in mind.

## Monocultures (agriculture)
Agricultural monocultures, or the practice of monocropping, **means growing the same crop on the same land year after year**. The main reasons for monocropping is the potential overall profitability, productivity, and efficiency. Another important reason for monocropping is predictability. When timber came from planted rows of trees instead of complex forests it became much easier to calculate current and future yields. Like many other predicaments agricultural monocultures provide potential short-term benefits while likely resulting in long-term cascades of problems.

## Agriculture
Agriculture is the **[cultivation and caring for the fields of the Earth](https://www.etymonline.com/word/culture#etymonline_v_452)**, generally with the purpose of providing us with food but also fuels, fibers, and other raw materials. It includes crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry. The introduction of agricultural practices during the Neolithic revolution more than 10,000 years ago started transitioning most of humanity from a life of hunting and gathering to a settled life of farming. It is not unreasonable to see this as the starting point of many of our predicaments. Even though that may be stating things too simplistically this change in our ways of life undeniably defines much of what life is for us in modern times. Importantly though, the magnitude of this change exploded the past 1000 years. A thousand years ago around 4% of Earth's usable land was used for warming. [This number today falls somewhere around 50%](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use).

## Supply chain fragility
**Fragile supply chains are sensitive to disruptions**. The COVID-19 pandemic showed clearly the lack of resilience of modern day global supply chains. As our civilisation tries to weather transition and collapse these low-probability high-impact events are likely to occur more often risking even larger disruptions to global supply chains.

## Globalisation
Globalisation is the worldwide process of interaction and integration among people, organisations, cultures, services, and more. Globalisation is sometimes seen as the stage following the (French) term mondialisation where it implies the "[the dissolution of national identities and the abolishment of borders inside the world network of economic exchanges](https://ideas.repec.org/a/ovi/oviste/vxiiy2012i2p27-30.html)".

## Energy
Energy is [activity and vigour](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek), energy is [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)), [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat), [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light), [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-translation_symmetry), [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy), [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_energy). Energy is [happiness, pleasure, and living force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality). Energy is life and all life needs energy. How we get and use energy is the central predicaments of existence and, for humanity, maybe more so now than ever before. Less philosophically, we get our energy from the sun in different forms which we then use and consume in order to live.

## Maximum power principle
> The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.
> 
>  - Howard T. Odum

The maximum power principle, as a fourth law of thermodynamics, is used as a principle to quantitatively describe biological evolution as **the maximum rate of useful energy transformation for any biological system**. More simply stated (by A.J. Lotka) "[the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in [using the energy for] the preservation of the species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principle)".

Another way of looking at it is that whoever manages to acquire and utilise the most power will live. Those who don't won't.

## Jevons paradox
[In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when **technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) This was originally related to the efficiency and increase in coal use. As technology improves energy efficiency we end up using more rather than less of the resource required for the activity. There is, in other words, always an important nuance to any discussion related to technological advances that promise increased efficiency in that they potentially worsen the problem they claim to solve.

## Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight
All of our energy originally comes from sunlight. The industrial revolution was in many ways made possible by the extraction and utilisation of stored ancient sunlight in the form of oil.

## Ignored externalities
An **externality is a cost or benefit caused by one party but incurred or received by another**. It is important to think of externalities not just as financial. More generally then, externalities are events occurring as a byproduct of another event. Many (most?) externalities of the modern economy are ignored and following the connections of current predicaments it is not an unreasonable claim that most predicaments are externalities to the current economic system.

## Unpaid important labour
While Adam Smith, the "Father of Capitalism", wrote "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest" he lived with his mother who cared, cooked, and cleaned for him with, I wonder, only a regard to her own interest? **Much important work goes unpaid and much unimportant work goes highly paid**. When progress in equality means both men and women can spend more time working for others and less time caring for their family and local community there must've been a fork in the road when we weren't looking.

## Consumerism
Consuming means [using up](https://www.etymonline.com/word/consume). Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the aspirations of individuals include using up more than is necessary for survival. Consumerism is mainly the result of free markets and the notion that **[the free choice of the consumers is what should orient the economic organisation of a society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism)**. Coincidentally, this gives companies a clear reason to blame the consumers for any externalities caused in the production of the products and services the consumers want and need. It isn't the companies fault that they just follow the will of the people, right?

## Investing
An investment is **[the commitment of resources to achieve later benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment)**.

Investments must include the notion of ownership and for an investment to be successful it usually means that either you won and someone else lost (zero-sum) or whatever area you invested in grew financially. Another important point is that any investment into something is an action that tries to shape the world, meaning that whatever is invested in will be pushed to succeed while whatever isn't invested in will be ignored.

## Capitalism
**[Capitalism is an economic system in which the means of production and distribution are privately or corporately owned and development occurs through the accumulation and reinvestment of profits gained in a free market](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/capitalism)**. Capitalism, when it is combined with technological developments and increased energy availability, is probably the main concrete driver behind many of our problems, their current solutions and, importantly, one of the reasons for much of our increased standard of living. As with most predicaments in the landscape it is crucial to identify, not what to reject, but how to balance the good with the bad for long-term thriving. There is plenty to criticise with the system of capitalism but this has to be done factoring in what it has done well in an attempt to bring that with us into whatever systems we choose as the alternative. For capitalism to continue in its current form there must be (more or less) infinite growth and with us approaching several planetary boundaries, and having passed many of them, growth is currently not a viable option, meaning capitalism most likely isn't one either, at least not in its current form.

> We live in capitalism. Its power seems inescapable. So did the divine right of kings. Any human power can be resisted and changed by human beings. Resistance and change often begin in art, and very often in our art, the art of words.
> 
>  - Ursula K. Le Guin

> ...all the operations of capitalism were as meaningless to him as the rites of a primitive religion, as barbaric, as elaborate, and as unnecessary.

## Growth
To grow is to increase, develop, get bigger, and, ideally, flourish. Growth in the predicament landscape mainly entails economic growth whose snooze-worthy definition is **the increase in the inflation-adjusted market value of the services and goods produced by an economy** over a certain amount of time, usually a year. When related to measurable welfare growth might be the best thing that ever happened to humanity and if unchanged and extrapolated into the future it might very well be the worst. Growth cannot continue indefinitely and many of our current predicaments come from the fact that there are limits to our growth.

## Illusion of GDP decoupling
GDP decoupling tends to, in general, mean the decoupling of GDP (or growth)
and carbon emissions. Taking a broader view would mean **decoupling GDP from any long-term detrimental externalities**. Taking an even broader view could mean increasing global welfare without increasing long-term detrimental externalities and, despite the predicament's title, this is not an unreasonable goal for humanity to have the coming years, ideally maintaining or increasing welfare while decreasing externalities. Now that is an impressive engineering challenge if I've ever seen one.

## Resources
As living beings there is no getting around the fact that we need resources for our continued survival. In many ways, the acquiring of resources and the management of waste is what defines a well-adapted living organism. Unfortunately, we're currently extracting and using resources in ways that don't give them time to [rise again](https://www.etymonline.com/word/resource), leading to resource depletion. 

There are several types of resources and these include, just to name a few, fossil fuels, minerals, metals, animals, water, humans, computing resources, air, and plants. Finding and employing the suitable methods of extraction and utilisation of these resources in sustainable amounts is crucial for our survival.

## Centralisation
**Centralisation is the process by which the activities of an entity become concentrated within a particular group** within that entity, especially activities related to power and control. This power structure creates a hierarchy where those situated in the higher group has influence over the rest of the entity. Centralisation can occur on different scales and in different types of entities and can have many benefits. However, when decisions that threaten the power of the higher group are required for the entity's continued existence things tend to get complicated. Centralised power in an entity also tends to reduce its capacity for complex responses to complex situations, the main reason for this being a lack of possibility for spontaneous emergent behaviour within the entity. We don't need a conductor if we've reached the end of our classical symphony, we need to listen and become jazz musicians in one large multi-faceted improvisational mess. The next big thing is many small things.

## Power concentration to the wrong people
For an entity to maintain its existence it is vital that, if power is to concentrate, it concentrates in those groups that have the entity's best in mind. The game theory of capitalism where the only way to not lose power is to win it and keep it, increasing ones optionality while the rest of the entity's options are narrowed. More concretely, people with power and money can do anything as long as they keep that power whereas the majority of the entity fall into a treadmill of working to ensure the maintenance of the higher group's power and financial increase. If one was to design a system that made sure the worst people climbed to the top, it would be something very close to what we've ended up with. It is vital that we either change some characteristics of our global economic system to ensure the right people are in power or change the hierarchical structure of the system to allow for more decentralised power structures.

## Cars
The car, or automobile, is a motor vehicle with wheels started to replace the horse-drawn carriage in the early 1900s and has since then become perhaps the main invention deciding on the scale of most places created by humans; nations, cities, villages. The car made it possible to travel further distances in less time leading to everything expanding out from ones home according to the timescales of driving instead of walking, biking, or riding. 

The emissions from cars make up [10-20% of global CO2 emissions](https://ourworldindata.org/ghg-emissions-by-sector) depending on what is being included and [close to a third of all primary microplastics released into the oceans](https://portals.iucn.org/library/sites/library/files/documents/2017-002-En.pdf). More land is required for roads and parking lots, there are few places without traffic noise, and traffic collisions are [the largest cause of injury-related deaths worldwide](https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/world-report-on-road-traffic-injury-prevention).

## Transportation infrastructure
The movement of people and their goods requires systems of transportation. Besides walking or running, modes of transportation include bikes, horses, animal-drawn carriages, boats, cars, motorcycles, planes, other air vehicles, railway vehicles, and more. These can further be divided into what power is driving them; air, electricity, fossil fuels, muscle, etc. Wheeled vehicles need roads and highways, boats need waterways and ports, airplanes need airports, trains and trams need railways, and people need safe places to walk. Horses just need peaceful retirement. [The road to hell is paved with asphalt and the road to asphalt is paved with incentives](https://devon.postach.io/post/the-road-to-hell-is-paved-with-asphalt) that, as with much else, ignore the long-term. Asphalt degrades fast, is expensive to change, absorbs heat, contributes to air pollution, and drains badly. Our transportation infrastructure has both caused and become necessary for the global market and, even if we choose to reject globalisation, will always be a deciding factor in designing a world suitable to humans.

## Public transport
**Public transport is a transport system available for use by the general public**. There are a few things that are necessary for a nation to claim to have a social welfare system. Public transport is one of these things. Public transport most commonly consists of trains, trams, buses, and ferries. Compared with other modes of transport public transport is generally regarded as significantly more energy efficient, it has the ability to move more people, it is cheaper for the passengers than vehicle ownership, and it reduces the overall amount of travelling vehicles. Downsides to public transport is a lack of transportation freedom as well as a difficulty transporting goods. There is freedom in being able to drive wherever and whenever you want with the car fully loaded with groceries that you drop off outside your door. An important consideration here, however, is that designing a city for private transport leads to people needing cars whereas designing for public transport leads to people not needing cars.

We can close our eyes or avert our gaze but our ears stay constantly receptive and open. **Traffic noise is, simply, any sound created by traffic**. Roadway noise created primarily by tires [rubbing across](https://www.etymonline.com/word/traffic) the roadway surface is the most prevalent form of environmental noise and there are few places in the modern world where this noise hasn't spread. Engines, transmissions, air resistance, braking, and any friction also contribute to traffic noise as well as horns and sirens.

## Travel
**Travel is the movement of people across space between different geographical locations**. It has never been as easy to travel as in modern times. It is so easy that travel is often seen as almost a right, a right to experience the world and go anywhere one wants. It is a difficult predicament. Travel might be the best way for humans to learn about the world and about other people. However, the more people can travel and the more globalised the world becomes one can go to the other side of the world and not really travel anywhere. How do we facilitate travel while keeping cultural and geographical diversity? How far does one have to go to travel?

## Electric vehicle solutions
Electric vehicles are vehicles that use electric motors for propulsion. Electric vehicles are potentially much more efficient than vehicles relying on fossil fuels but they come with other problems. Moving away from fossil fuel-dependent vehicles is of high importance but **electric vehicles are often the right answer to the wrong question**. Electric cars are not mainly meant to save the climate, they're meant to save the car industry. As with all predicaments we must consider where electric vehicle solutions fit in with the rest of the landscape. Beware of good solutions to the wrong problems.

## Limits to growth
> The ultimate meaning to which all stories refer has two faces: the continuity of life, the inevitability of death.
> 
> - Italo Calvino

There are limits to growth in a finite system. What happens in the interaction between Earth's and humanity's systems when humanity tries to grow indefinitely?

Lets look at what the limits might be. The Limits to Growth report bases their model on five variables: population, food production, industrialisation, pollution, and consumption of nonrenewable natural resources. I think an even simpler way of looking at limits to growth is looking at input requirements and output management. If a set of systems requires an input of finite resources larger than the renewal of that resource it will deplete that resource. Also, if a set of systems produces waste that is larger than it can manage through reuse, recycling, or removal it will eventually cause irreversible disruption. 

The Limits to Growth further concludes that if growth continues the most probable result is rapid, sudden, and uncontrollable decline in population and industrial capacity; that *it is possible* to alter these growth trends to establish a condition of ecological and economic stability that is indefinitely sustainable; and that the chances of succeeding in altering these trends increase the earlier we start striving for it. This report was written in 1972.

> These conclusions are so far-reaching and raise so many questions for further study that we are quite frankly overwhelmed by the enormity of the job that must be done. We hope that this book will serve to interest other people, in many fields of study and in many countries of the world, to raise the space and time horizons of their concerns, and to join us in understanding and preparing for a period of great transition – the transition from growth to global equilibrium.
> 
>  - The Limits to Growth

The Limits to Growth report has been criticised from many angles and there are of course important additions such as the effect of technological development on the possibilities for further growth. The problem with the technology argument is treated in other predicaments but put simply when related to the limits to growth, we will not escape the fact that humans need resources and a way to manage its waste and we are not closer to solving this technology now than we were during the writing of the original 1972 report.

## Biased evidence selection
**Biased evidence selection means selecting true facts that support only one side of an argument**. A fact being true doesn't mean you have the whole truth about something. Many things in the world have gotten better the past hundred years and many things have gotten worse, only looking at one side will give you an untrue model of the world. Two opposing facts about something can both be true. Healthcare can both have gotten better and worse. Education can both have gotten better and worse. The Rosling-Pinker narrative tends to go hand in hand with the naive progress narrative claiming that everything is getting better and with time and technology we will end up living in a utopia. 

To illustrate this we can look at Hans Rosling's famous example of washing machines. In short, he saw washing machines as a proxy for increased equality and socio-economic status. Women wouldn't need to spend all that time on tough manual labour every day to keep their families' clothes clean. Instead they could now... Well, what? Important to note is that I have no intention of glorifying either poverty or manual labour, rather, I want to point out the opposite side of a commonly one-sided evidence of progress. What the women freed from the labour of washing clothes now have more time for is, most often, working in the global economic system. This could be getting a job in a factory. What might end up happening is that women who had a routine of washing clothes with other women in the community, talking, gossiping, building relations, and being home and caring for their children now have less time in their local community, less time with their children, but more time working for someone else. If a factory gets built near a community, allowing the community to earn enough money to buy washing machines, the factory is seen as a humanitarian success, the backside being a lack of time and potentially a polluted river where once women were working and singing together. Or not. Do we believe we understand?

## Simplifications
How do we make sense of the world? We generally do it through developing **models that act as simplifications of the world**. This is necessary and useful. It is not unlikely that this model-making and ability for recursive abstraction is what makes the human mind different from other minds. The simplified models allow us to form an understanding of how an animal functions and moves while recursive abstraction allows us to go from the understanding that biting can penetrate the animal's skin to an insight into teeth, force, sharpness, and furthermore the development of the bow and arrow. 

The problem arises when we start overrelying on simplifications and models to the extent that we fail to make sense of the complexity of the world. It is sometimes said that if you can't explain something simply you do not understand it. I would counter that with perhaps the controversial view that *if you truly and deeply understand something you might not be able to explain it at all*. 

The world and everything in it is infinitely complex and simplifications serve as good models. However, when we accept these simplifications as accurate depictions of the world we lose our ability to act when the world acts in ways the models didn't predict. If we keep our simplified world view the risk is that the world starts [simplifying us](https://www.thegreatsimplification.com/about).

## Hobbesian views
Humans are at their core mechanistic. Left to their own devices they would live in a war of all against all, completely lacking industry, culture, knowledge, art, literature, society, and instead live in a constant state of fear and danger of violent death. A solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short life. According to Thomas Hobbes that is. Humans need to be controlled through a social contract and a civil society with one sovereign authority in control of everything in order to protect them, he continues. 

There are surely some truths to be found in Hobbes' theories of moral and political philosophy, especially with regards to a machine constructed by human beings that somehow controls them more than they control it. Nevertheless, Hobbesian views will most likely lead to the creation of the very mechanistic creatures it wants to control. How we see determines what we see.

What must be done to ensure our continued survival is nothing short of radical so if someone claims you're being too radical you might be approaching a path forward.

## Being reasonable
> There are so many different kinds of stupidity, and cleverness is one of the worst.
> 
>  - Thomas Mann

**To be reasonable is, or rather should be, to think through and to understand**. Most features of our predicament landscape have arisen due to our commitment to (try to) be reasonable. Bordering on unreasonably reasonable.  To stop deforestation is not seen as reasonable, to [cut down most of the old growth forests](https://theconversation.com/sweden-has-vast-old-growth-forests-but-they-are-being-chopped-down-faster-than-the-amazon-218753) apparently is. Reasoning has its merits but it seems we must dare to be a bit unreasonable to be able to manage our modern predicaments. All reasoning tends to follow a certain optimisation and prioritisation and if we haven't figured out what to optimise for (meta-optimisation) our reasoning has little value.

## Rationalism
**Rationalism is the epistemological view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge in which the criterion of truth is not sensory but intellectual and deductive**. Rationalism and its main principles of logic, mathematics, and metaphysics are important tools for thinking but exclusive reliance on rational thinking risks the thinker ending up in a world of representation whose bonds with present reality are silently cut. The main method of ensuring the representations are grounded in reality is through science and quantification/mathematics which, as other predicaments detail, leads one to bias ones thinking towards what is quantifiable while having difficulty factoring in what isn't. It is important to note that rationalism in and of itself is not problematic. A lack of balance and an exclusive focus on rationalism as the be all and end all of the thinking process is what makes it into a current predicament.

I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the economies of attention to instead _attend, tend to, and show tenderness_ to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention. - Me

For many generations…they obeyed the laws and loved the divine to which they were akin…they reckoned that qualities of character were far more important than their present prosperity.

But when the divine element in them became weakened…and their human traits became predominant, they ceased to be able to carry their prosperity with moderation.

## Game theory power play

## Complexity mismatch
For a system to be resilient it is required to have **complex responses to complex threats**. When the behaviour of the threat is more complex than the response of the system it is unlikely that the system will respond in a way that ensures its continued existence. This is a complexity mismatch.

A simple illustrating example of a complexity mismatch with regards to ecosystems could be comparing an old growth forest and a planted forest. An old growth forest consisting of an intricate web of thousands or millions of organisms all contributing to the maintenance of their dwelling place (*oikos/eco*) makes it resilient to change, its complexity creating a nearly infinite amount of responses to any major destabilising event. In contrast to this a planted forest consisting of a single type of tree will most likely not have the time or the conditions to develop much complexity leading to the risk that even a minor destabilising event causes a complete collapse.

In the middle of the forest there’s an unexpected clearing that can only be found by those who have gotten lost.

The clearing is surrounded by a forest that is choking itself. Black trunks with the lichen’s bristly beard. The jammed trees are dead all the way to the top, there a few solitary green branches touch the light. Underneath:  
shadows sitting on the shadows, the marsh increasing.

But in the clearing the grass is curiously green and alive. Big stones lie around as if placed that way. They must have been foundation stones for a house, maybe I’m wrong. Who lived there? No one can help with that. The name sleeps somewhere in the archive no one opens (only archives remain young). The oral tradition is dead, and with it the memories. The gypsy tribe remembers, but those who can write forget. Write it down and forget it.

This little house hums with voices. It is the center of the world. But the people in it die or move away. The history ends. The place stands empty year after year. Ant he crofter’s house becomes a sphinx. At the end everything has gone away except the foundation stones.

I’ve been here before somehow, but it’s time to leave. I dive in among the briary underbrush. To get through it you have to take one step forward and two steps to the side, like a chess piece. Slowly it thins out and the light increases. My steps grow longer. A path wiggles its way toward me. I am back in the communications net.

On the humming high voltage pole a beetle sits in the sun. Under his gleaming shoulders his flight wings are lying, folded as ingeniously as a parachute packed by an expert.

What is required is an attentive response to something real and other than ourselves, of which we have only inklings at first, but which comes more and more into being through our response to it – if we are truly responsive to it. We nurture it into being; or not. In this it has something of the structure of love. - Iain McGilchrist

Love is the Extremely difficult realization that something other than oneself is real - Iris Murdoch

## Loneliness

## Useless elders
> 156. Settled work
> ### Problem
> 
> The experience of settled work is a prerequisite for peace of mind in old age. Yet our society undermines this experience by making a rift between working life and retirement, and between workplace and home.
> 
> ### Solution
> 
> Give each person, especially as they grow old, the chance to set up a workplace of their own, within or very near their home. Make it a place that can grow slowly, perhaps in the beginning sustaining a weekend hobby and gradually becoming a complete, productive, and comfortable workshop
