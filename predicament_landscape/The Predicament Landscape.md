## Soil erosion
**Soil erosion is the wearing away of the upper layer of soil**. This thin layer of dust on the crusty surface of a billiard ball is what supports all life. Without it nothing can grow or live.

We are [gnawing away](https://www.etymonline.com/word/erosion) at the topsoil of the Earth with increasing speed and ferocity, consuming what isn't ours.

> It is not our part to master all the tides of the world, but to do what is in us for the succour of those years wherein we are set, uprooting the evil in the fields that we know, so that those who live after may have clean earth to till.
> 
> - Gandalf (J.R.R. Tolkien), Lord of the Rings

Soil erosion has several causes, some (or presently most) which are affected or generated by human activities. These include agricultural practices such as tillage, monocropping, pesticide use, and chemical fertilizers; deforestation, roads and cities, as well as climate change more generally.

> For many years, my walks have taken me down an old fencerow in a wooded hollow on what was once my grandfather’s farm. A battered galvanized bucket is hanging on a fence post near the head of the hollow, and I never go by it without stopping to look inside. For what is going on in that bucket is the most momentous thing I know, the greatest miracle that I have ever heard of: it is making earth.
> 
> The old bucket has hung there through many autumns, and leaves have fallen around it and some have fallen into it. Rain and snow have fallen into it, and the fallen leaves have held the moisture and so have rotted. Nuts have fallen into it, or been carried into it by squirrels; mice and squirrels have eaten the meat of the nuts and left the shells; they and other animals have left their droppings; insects have flown into the bucket and died and decayed; birds have scratched in it and left their droppings and perhaps a feather or two. This slow work of growth and death, gravity and decay, which is the chief work of the world, has by now produced in the bottom of the bucket several inches of black soil…The old bucket started out a far better one than you can buy now. I think it has been hanging on that post for something like fifty years.
> 
> However small a landmark the old bucket is, it is not trivial. It is one of the signs by which I know my country and myself. And to me it is irresistibly suggestive in the way it collects leaves and other woodland sheddings as they fall through time. It collects stories, too, as they fall through time. It is irresistibly metaphorical. It is doing in a passive way what a human community must do actively and thoughtfully. A human community, too, must collect leaves and stories, and turn them to account. It must build soil, and build that memory of itself- in lore and story and song- that will be its culture. These two kinds of accumulation, of local soil and local culture, are intimately related.
> 
> In the woods, the bucket is no metaphor; it simply reveals what is always happening in the woods, if the woods is left alone. Of course, in most places in my part of the country, the human community did not leave the woods alone. It felled the trees and replaced them with pastures and crops. But this did not revoke the law of the woods, which is that the ground must be protected by a cover of vegetation and that the growth of the years must return- or be returned- to the ground to rot and build soil. A good local culture, in one of its most important functions, is a collection of the memories, ways, and skills necessary for the observance…of this natural law.
> 
> If the local culture cannot preserve and improve the local soil, then, as both reason and history inform us, the local community will decay and perish, and the work of soil building will be resumed by nature. A human community, then, if it is to last long, must exert a sort of centripetal force, holding local soil and local memory in place. Practically speaking, human society has no work more important than this.

## Pollution
**Pollution is the introduction of contaminants into the natural environment that cause adverse change**. It comes not only in the form of chemicals but rather it can be almost anything. Air pollution, electromagnetic, light, litter, noise, chemical, radioactive, visual, thermal, medial, water, material, mental, physical, etc. We live in an increasingly polluted world where [no place is left clean](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.est.2c02592).

Pollution is [defilement and desacration](https://www.etymonline.com/search?q=pollution).

## Tipping points
Many complex systems have the characteristic that **after a certain amount of gradual change a tipping point is reached where the entire system changes drastically** or even completely collapses. The possibility of unknown tipping points makes any attempt at delaying the management of current predicaments potentially catastrophic. An important addition, however, is that tipping points can be both negative and positive, meaning that identifying and working towards positive tipping points should be of high priority. One example of such a tipping point might be that if a certain number of people begin changing how we do things it might create a discrete phase shift that rapidly includes everyone in the change process.

## Ecological crisis
Ecology is the [study of our dwelling place](https://www.etymonline.com/word/ecology), more specifically a field of science studying the interconnected systems of Earth. 

**The ecological crisis is a destabilisation or breakdown of these systems large enough to threaten humanity's continued survival**. It is, however, important to include other organisms in this since the ongoing man-made ecological crises are causing the extinction of multiple species every day. From a systems-thinking perspective every species going extinct reduces an ecosystem's options to restabilise after a destabilising event. It is therefore not unlikely that we end up snowballing the effects of climate change by reducing the resilience and complexity of ecosystems past the point where a recovery is possible. (See Complexity mismatch.)

## Extreme weather
**Extreme weather is any weather condition at the extremes of whatever has been observed and recorded in the past** and includes heat waves, cold waves, storms, etc.

The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report defines an extreme weather event as "an event that is rare at a particular place and time of year. Definitions of 'rare' vary, but an extreme weather event would normally be as rare as or rarer than the 10th or 90th percentile of a probability density function estimated from observations."

Human activites is most likely the main driver of the increased frequency of extreme weather events. 

Extreme weather can also act as warnings and omens. Will we listen?

## Biodiversity loss
Biodiversity is often defined as "the totality of genes, species, and ecosystems of a region". Another definition might be *variety of life*. Biodiversity loss could therefore be seen as a **reduction in the variety of life**.

Biodiversity loss can include the decrease, disappearance, or extinction of a species in a specific area or globally. The currently primary driver of biodiversity loss appears to be habitat destruction (mainly for agriculture), which includes deforestation, as well as climate change more generally. [The current rate of global biodiversity loss is estimated to be 100 to 1000 higher than the naturally occurring rate which is faster than at any other time in human history](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Biodiversity_loss).

The ongoing biodiversity loss is sometimes called the holocene extinction.

## Desertification
[Desertification is a type of land degradation whereby fertile areas become arid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification). This typically results from deforestation, drought, or inappropriate agricultural practices. 

Comparing a [map of global desertification vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Desertification#/media/File:Desertification_map.png) with a [map of armed conflicts](https://ourworldindata.org/explorers/countries-in-conflict-data?facet=none&Measure=Conflict+deaths&Conflict+type=All+armed+conflicts&Conflict+sub-type=Across+all+sub-types&country=AFG~ETH~SYR~UKR) hints at something.

## Deforestation
**Deforestation is the removal and destruction of forests**. [The UN FAO estimate that 10 million hectares of forest are cut down each year.](https://ourworldindata.org/deforestation) Two points of importance: one is that there is a difference between deforestation and net forest loss since forests are also regrowing and being replanted, second is that deforestation peaked in the 1980s. It is, however, also important to note that not all forests are equal and here we run into the potential issue with relying too heavily on quantification. We could most likely make most of the planet net positive in forest growth quite quickly by planting trees faster than we're removing them. The question is if we have a reason to trust our claimed understanding of the differences between artificially planted forests and naturally growing ones. Maybe we do? Do we truly understand what a forest is or are we missing it for all the trees?

## Climate change
**Global changes in average temperature**, [from equator to poles](https://www.etymonline.com/word/climate), means a change in the Earth's climate. The climate is never static but what makes climate change a predicament is the speed at which it is currently happening, threatening the stability of the Earth's climate system and thereby our survival. Put simply, human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, agricultural practices, and industrial practices add greenhouse gases which trap heat in the lower atmosphere. This leads to global warming and rapid climate change. The global nature of climate change means it contributes to and potentially creates several related predicaments. This is the main reason why climate change specifically is a main focus in the discussion of our continued survival. It is, however, not certain that lowering the global temperature by any means necessary will lead to the desired effects. 

In some ways the predicament of climate change has been defined too narrowly, potentially leading to an illusion of understanding its complexity and thereby trusting that a solution is within our grasp as soon as we choose to grab it. This is one reason for why such a "simple" problem hasn't been prioritised at the cost of growth. Every predicament is interrelated but the increase in trapped energy on Earth might end up affecting all of it.

## Microplastics
**Microplastics are small fragments of any type of plastic** (<5 mm). Unless they are designed to be biodegradable they tend to accumulate in the environment, particularly in water but also the air and soil. They are mobile, persistent, and difficult to remove from nature. [Over 80% of the microplastic in the environment comes from textiles, tires, and city dust](https://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/microplastics-from-textiles-towards-a). The environmental and health impacts of microplastics are uncertain but it isn't unreasonable to think that an accumulation of synthetic non-degradable material in all living organisms could end up being catastrophic. 

> Although man’s record as a steward of the natural resources of the earth has been a discouraging one, there has long been a certain comfort in the belief that the sea, at least, was inviolate, beyond man’s ability to change and to despoil. But this belief, unfortunately, has proved to be naïve.

## Ocean acidification
**Ocean acidification means an increased concentration of hydrogen ions in seawater**, meaning more acidic water. [The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html) and a series of chemical reactions means this absorption of carbon dioxide leads to an increase in hydrogen ions. The ocean turns sour. As we continue to annoy the ocean and destabilise it we are risking disrupting all life it contains and supports. To be blunt, this includes us and everything else. Don't piss off the ocean.

> It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.

## Loss of insect biomass
Insects make up 90% of all animal species on Earth and are crucial parts of all ecosystems with pollinators being particularly important for the food supply for other animals and humans. Insect decline is a complex area to study and estimates on the rate of decline vary in different localities. A 2020 meta-analysis estimated a decline rate of 9% per decade for terrestrial insects but, notably, an increase in freshwater insects of 11% per decade. Most research, however, show declines in insects globally.

> A March 2019 statement by the [Entomological Society of America](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entomological_Society_of_America "Entomological Society of America") said there was not yet sufficient data to predict an imminent mass extinction of insects and that some of the extrapolated predictions might "have been extended well past the limits of the data or have been otherwise over-hyped"

I wonder what to make of the quote above. Data can always be misleading but if we are actually risking a mass extinction of insects I don't see how taking that seriously is over-hyping.

> We urgently need an end to these false assurances, to the sugar coating of unpalatable facts. It is the public that is being asked to assume the risks that the insect controllers calculate. The public must decide whether it wishes to continue on the present road, and it can do so only when in full possession of the facts.

## Waste
**[Waste is anything discarded as worthless or of no use](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/waste)**. To waste is to use something carelessly. The [majority of material waste comes from mining](https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/total-waste-generation) and quarrying which, in 2019, was at around 450 million tonnes compared with household material waste at around 2 million that same year. There's nothing wrong with doing your recycling to play your part but just keep that disparity in mind.

## Monocultures (agriculture)
Agricultural monocultures, or the practice of monocropping, **means growing the same crop on the same land year after year**. The main reasons for monocropping is the potential overall profitability, productivity, and efficiency. Like many other predicaments agricultural monocultures provide potential short-term benefits while likely resulting in long-term cascades of problems.

## Agriculture
Agriculture is the **[cultivation and caring for the fields of the Earth](https://www.etymonline.com/word/culture#etymonline_v_452)**, generally with the purpose of providing us with food but also fuels, fibers, and other raw materials. It includes crops, livestock, aquaculture, fisheries, and forestry. The introduction of agricultural practices during the Neolithic revolution more than 10,000 years ago started transitioning most of humanity from a life of hunting and gathering to a settled life of farming. It is not unreasonable to see this as the starting point of many of our predicaments. Even though that may be stating things too simplistically this change in our ways of life undeniably defines much of what life is for us in modern times. Importantly though, the magnitude of this change exploded the past 1000 years. A thousand years ago around 4% of Earth's usable land was used for warming. [This number today falls somewhere around 50%](https://ourworldindata.org/land-use).

## Supply chain fragility
**Fragile supply chains are sensitive to disruptions**. The COVID-19 pandemic showed clearly the lack of resilience of modern day global supply chains. As our civilisation tries to weather transition and collapse these low-probability high-impact events are likely to occur more often risking even larger disruptions to global supply chains.

## Energy
Energy is [activity and vigour](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E1%BC%90%CE%BD%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B3%CE%B5%CE%B9%CE%B1#Ancient_Greek), energy is [work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)), [heat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat), [light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light), [flow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-translation_symmetry), [electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrical_energy), [sound](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_energy). Energy is [happiness, pleasure, and living force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potentiality_and_actuality). Energy is life and all life needs energy. Less philosophically, we get our energy from the sun in different forms which we then use and consume in order to live.

## Maximum power principle
> The maximum power principle can be stated: During self-organization, system designs develop and prevail that maximize power intake, energy transformation, and those uses that reinforce production and efficiency.
> 
>  - Howard T. Odum

The maximum power principle, as a fourth law of thermodynamics, is used as a principle to quantitatively describe biological evolution as **the maximum rate of useful energy transformation for any biological system**. More simply stated (by A.J. Lotka) "[the advantage must go to those organisms whose energy-capturing devices are most efficient in [using the energy for] the preservation of the species](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_power_principle)".

Another way of looking at it is that whoever manages to acquire and utilise the most power will live. Those who don't won't.

## Jevons paradox
[In economics, the Jevons paradox occurs when **technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used, but the falling cost of use induces increases in demand enough that resource use is increased, rather than reduced**.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jevons_paradox) This was originally related to the efficiency and increase in coal use. As technology improves energy efficiency we end up using more rather than less of the resource required for the activity. There is, in other words, always an important nuance to any discussion related to technological advances that promise increased efficiency in that they potentially worsen the problem they claim to solve.

## Ancient sunlight, old sunlight, current sunlight
All of our energy originally comes from sunlight. The industrial revolution was in many ways made possible by the extraction and utilisation of stored ancient sunlight in the form of oil. How we choose to divide our usage of ancient, old, and current sunlight is one way of looking at managing our energy predicament.

## Net negative caloric extraction
In the U.S. [approximately 7 calories are used to produce 1 calorie of food](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/303895662_The_Food_and_Farming_Transition) energy. This ratio combined with the [exosomatic energy use](http://www.ejolt.org/2012/12/human-energy-use-endosomatic-exosomatic/) presents a picture of a highly **in**efficient food system.

## Ignored externalities
An **externality is a cost or benefit caused by one party but incurred or received by another**. It is important to think of externalities not just as financial. More generally then, externalities are events occurring as a byproduct of another event. Many (most?) externalities of the modern economy are ignored and following the connections of current predicaments it is not an unreasonable claim that most predicaments are externalities to the current economic system.

## Unpaid important labour
While Adam Smith, the "Father of Capitalism", wrote "It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker, that we expect our dinner, but from their regard to their own interest" he lived with his mother who cared, cooked, and cleaned for him with, I wonder, only a regard to her own interest? **Much important work goes unpaid and much unimportant work goes highly paid**. When progress in equality means both men and women can spend more time working for others and less time caring for their family and local community there must've been a fork in the road when we weren't looking.

## Consumerism
Consuming means [using up](https://www.etymonline.com/word/consume). Consumerism is a social and economic order in which the aspirations of individuals include using up more than is necessary for survival. Consumerism is mainly the result of free markets and the notion that **[the free choice of the consumers is what should orient the economic organisation of a society](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consumerism)**. Coincidentally, this gives companies a clear reason to blame the consumers for any externalities caused in the production of the products and services the consumers want and need. It isn't the companies fault that they just follow the will of the people, right?

## Investing
An investment is **[the commitment of resources to achieve later benefits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Investment)**. There are many types of investments such as stocks, bonds, cash, real estate, loans, cryptocurrencies, and more. Investments must include the notion of ownership and for an investment to be successful it usually means that either you won and someone else lost (zero-sum) or whatever area you invested in grew financially. Another important point is that any investment into something is an action that tries to shape the world, meaning that whatever is invested in will be pushed to succeed while whatever isn't invested in will be ignored.

I'm open to the fact that doing nothing might be the most active thing we can do to change things. Rejecting the economies of attention to instead _attend, tend to, and show tenderness_ to the things that are needed, to that which needs our attention more than ever, that is what truly needs doing. Never before has there been such urgency to not be urgent. Pay attention. - Me

But when the divine element in them became weakened…and their human traits became predominant, they ceased to be able to carry their prosperity with moderation.

## Complexity mismatch
For a system to be resilient it is required to have **complex responses to complex threats**. When the behaviour of the threat is more complex than the response of the system it is unlikely that the system will respond in a way that ensures its continued existence. This is a complexity mismatch.

A simple illustrating example of a complexity mismatch with regards to ecosystems could be comparing an old growth forest and a planted forest. An old growth forest consisting of an intricate web of thousands or millions of organisms all contributing to the maintenance of their dwelling place (*oikos/eco*) makes it resilient to change, its complexity creating a nearly infinite amount of responses to any major destabilising event. In contrast to this a planted forest consisting of a single type of tree will most likely not have the time or the conditions to develop much complexity leading to the risk that even a minor destabilising event causes a complete collapse.

Of all tyrannies, a tyranny sincerely exercised for the good of its victims may be the most oppressive. It would be better to live under robber barons than under omnipotent moral busybodies.

## The minimisation of all things wild
In the middle of the forest there’s an unexpected clearing that can only be found by those who have gotten lost.

The clearing is surrounded by a forest that is choking itself. Black trunks with the lichen’s bristly beard. The jammed trees are dead all the way to the top, there a few solitary green branches touch the light. Underneath:  
shadows sitting on the shadows, the marsh increasing.

But in the clearing the grass is curiously green and alive. Big stones lie around as if placed that way. They must have been foundation stones for a house, maybe I’m wrong. Who lived there? No one can help with that. The name sleeps somewhere in the archive no one opens (only archives remain young). The oral tradition is dead, and with it the memories. The gypsy tribe remembers, but those who can write forget. Write it down and forget it.

This little house hums with voices. It is the center of the world. But the people in it die or move away. The history ends. The place stands empty year after year. Ant he crofter’s house becomes a sphinx. At the end everything has gone away except the foundation stones.

I’ve been here before somehow, but it’s time to leave. I dive in among the briary underbrush. To get through it you have to take one step forward and two steps to the side, like a chess piece. Slowly it thins out and the light increases. My steps grow longer. A path wiggles its way toward me. I am back in the communications net.

On the humming high voltage pole a beetle sits in the sun. Under his gleaming shoulders his flight wings are lying, folded as ingeniously as a parachute packed by an expert.
