<h1>The Predicament Landscape</h1>

<p><strong>Predicaments</strong>
Problems require solutions, predicaments require management. Predicaments in the landscape are categories of a unfortunate or trying conditions. The landscape further includes the main predicament of modern day humanity, namely the complex and extensive network of connections between the predicaments. These connections are the reason why we seem unable to untangle ourselves from what appears to be solvable, if not already solved, problems. If we do not manage the predicaments of the landscape wisely we will lose everything. This is the challenge of our time and we must attempt to make sense of it to the best of our ability. This landscape attempts to do that. By mapping the landscape and its features, describing what they are and how they&#39;re connected, my belief is that we might be able to go from an oversimplified narrative to a slightly more complex and interconnected understanding of our predicament.</p>
<p><strong>Ecology, Philosophy, and Poetry</strong>
No single branch of science or the arts is enough to make sense of the complexity of our predicament. Instead, this project will move in-between and on the edges of whatever disciplines are necessary. There are however three that stick out, namely: ecology, philosophy, and poetry. Ecology is the study of our dwelling place. Philosophy is a love of wisdom as well as a comprehensive system of belief and principles. Poetry is... a difficult one to define. Which is its strength. Poetry is the process of emergence of something that did not previously exist. Poetry is making. Poetry tries to capture the unspeakable in words. Putting all of these together as ecophilosopoetic:</p>
<p><em>A philosophy for the making of our dwelling place</em></p>
<p><strong>The future</strong>
Discovering this landscape might lead to a sense of impending doom, hopelessness, and despair. Maybe rightly so. William Gibson said &quot;the future has arrived, it&#39;s just not evenly distributed&quot;. There are ways of managing these predicaments and their connections and many are already being employed. I therefore finish off every description of a predicament and its connections with a more speculative discussion of existing or potential management methods. The positive thing with complexity in this case is that just as we can&#39;t know what creates negative cascade effects we also can&#39;t be sure what creates positive ones. Complexity allows for emergence and unexpected behaviour. In other words, if there is room for complete despair there is also room for hope. My intention is two-fold. First, it is vital to recognise just how difficult of a situation we are in and, second, it is crucial to recognise that there are things we can and must do to manage the situation. What area of the landscape do you have an interest in? What predicament could you help manage? Which predicaments are related to what you&#39;re working to change? How might changing those predicaments affect the management of the predicament you&#39;re focused on? Are there people prioritising predicaments you don&#39;t care about? Why do you think they prioritise in that way and what might be the reason for your indifference? </p>
<p>A problem well-stated is half-solved. This landscape does not give solutions nor answers. My hope is that it leads those exploring it to find agency in discovering the right questions.</p>

<p><strong>Note: In Progress</strong>
As you can probably see, much of the landscape is undiscovered. I have chosen to work publicly on this project and new predicaments will be revealed on a weekly basis until the entire landscape has been mapped.</p>
<p><strong>Note: Disagreement</strong>
Do you disagree with something? Do you think something is blatantly wrong or deluded? Do you think something here might create more problems? Do you have something you think should be added? Don&#39;t hesitate to write me an email. I&#39;m grateful for any feedback or input that you might have. I&#39;m not an expert, I&#39;m just an innocent explorer trying to slowly wander upon truths.</p>

<p><strong>Note: For Hilma</strong>
I put several hours into this each day and this wouldn&#39;t be possible without me quitting my previous job. If you have found value in this project and you have a steady income I would be grateful for any donations you could give. If you need further incentive most of the donations will go to feeding my dog Hilma.</p>
