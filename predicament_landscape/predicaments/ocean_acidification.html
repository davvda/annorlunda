<h2>Ocean acidification</h2>
<p><strong>Ocean acidification means an increased concentration of hydrogen ions in seawater</strong>, meaning more acidic water. <a href="https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/acidification.html">The ocean absorbs about 30% of the carbon dioxide released in the atmosphere</a> and a series of chemical reactions means this absorption of carbon dioxide leads to an increase in hydrogen ions. The ocean turns sour. As we continue to annoy the ocean and destabilise it we are risking disrupting all life it contains and supports. To be blunt, this includes us and everything else. Don&#39;t piss off the ocean.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is a curious situation that the sea, from which life first arose should now be threatened by the activities of one form of that life. But the sea, though changed in a sinister way, will continue to exist; the threat is rather to life itself.</p>
