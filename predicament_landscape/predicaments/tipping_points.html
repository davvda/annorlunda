<h2>Tipping points</h2>
<p>Many complex systems have the characteristic that <strong>after a certain amount of gradual change a tipping point is reached where the entire system changes drastically</strong> or even completely collapses. The possibility of unknown tipping points makes any attempt at delaying the management of current predicaments potentially catastrophic. An important addition, however, is that tipping points can be both negative and positive, meaning that identifying and working towards positive tipping points should be of high priority. One example of such a tipping point might be that if a certain number of people begin changing how we do things it might create a discrete phase shift that rapidly includes everyone in the change process.</p>
